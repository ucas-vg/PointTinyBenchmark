        of assigned gt.
        The assignment is done in the following steps, the order matters.

        1. assign every prediction to -1
        2. compute the weighted costs
        3. chosen positive with costs
        4. assign all to 0 (background) first, then for each matched pair

           and assign the corresponding gt index (plus 1) to it.

            img_meta (dict): Meta information for current image.
            gt_bboxes_ignore (Tensor, optional): Ground truth bboxes that are
                labelled as `ignored`. Default None.
            eps (int | float, optional): A value added to the denominator for

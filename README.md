## ECCV2022, Point-to-Box Network for Accurate Object Detection via Single Point Supervision
P2BNet
--------------

P2BNet a newly proposed method for point-supervised object detection tasks on [PointTinyBenchmark](https://github.com/ucas-vg/PointTinyBenchmark), which is based on [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). 

To date, It implements the following algorithms:
* [Point-to-Box Network for Accurate Object Detection via Single Point Supervision (ECCV2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06827) [Details](TOV_mmdetection/README.md)
* Paper is avaliable here: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06827](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06827)
